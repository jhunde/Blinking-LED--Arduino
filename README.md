1. Connect a wire into `GND` on the Arduino board
  
    A. Connect the other end of that wire into the `GND` (negative voltage rail) of a breadboard
2. Connect a new wire into `Power`(positive voltage rail) of the breadboard

    A.  Connect the other end of that wire into the `Cathode` (negative) of **LED** on the breadboard

3.  Connect `Anode` (positive) pin of **LED** to a  **330 Ohm resistor**

4. Connect the other end of **resistor** inot pin 13 of the Arduino UNO board
